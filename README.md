# Social Network Analysis (SNA) Repository

## Overview
This repository provides a comprehensive collection of Social Network Analysis (SNA) techniques and methodologies. It encompasses advanced graph analytics, centrality measures, hyperlink-induced topic search (HITS), eigenvector calculations, and sentiment analysis using SNA. The objective is to offer practical implementations that enable deep insights into network structures and their influence across various domains.

## Key Features
- **Graph Modeling**: Construction and analysis of complex networks using state-of-the-art methodologies.
- **HITS Algorithm**: Implementation of the Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) algorithm for ranking nodes based on hub and authority scores.
- **Modality Analysis**: Examination of different modalities within network structures to understand their impact.
- **Eigenvector Centrality**: Quantification of node influence within a network using eigenvector-based calculations.
- **Centrality Measures**: Comprehensive evaluation of degree, betweenness, closeness, and eigenvector centrality to identify key nodes.
- **Project Implementations**: Application of SNA in real-world scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness in problem-solving.
- **Sentiment Analysis in SNA**: Integration of sentiment classification and network-based sentiment propagation techniques to derive actionable insights.

## Usage
This repository is designed for researchers, data scientists, and professionals seeking to leverage SNA for various analytical purposes. Each module includes well-documented code and use cases to facilitate ease of implementation and understanding.
